# NAE-Nitrogen-Analysis
This project was completed for Computer and Problem Solving (ENGI 1331) at the University of Houston in Spring 2019. For this project we used MATLAB to process 20 years of nitrogen usage data of all 3006 counties in the United States. This allowed us to see how nitrogen usage has changed over the years in the 5 regions of the contiguous US, as well as predict future trends. This project was a collaboration by Justin Francisco, Christian Arreola, Nathan Cao, Sameer Ahmad, Aiden Dalrymple, and Colby Bowers.

Note: The Excel files used are not our own. We retieved them from the public government websites listed in the Sources file. Also, this project was not organized on Github from the beginning. I am uploading it after the fact as a means to archive it. NitrogenAnalysis.m is the MATLAB file that should be ran to execute the code. The other .m files are called by the main file just mentioned.
